# Testing STL Model Loading

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Open the application**
   ```bash
   # In your browser, navigate to:
   http://localhost/nginxdir/plcsim7/index.html
   ```

2. **Switch to 3D View**
   - Click **🎲 3D Model** button in header

3. **Wait for sidebar to load**
   - Left sidebar should show:
     ```
     3D CAD Models
     ✅ 6 CAD models available (STL format)
     
     [Motor Controller (23MB)]
     [PLC CPU (26MB)]
     [Circuit Breaker (43MB)]
     [Emergency Push Button (12MB)]
     [PCB Mount Relay (0.8MB)]
     [Stack LED Light (14MB)]
     ```

4. **Click any model button**
   - Model should appear in 3D scene
   - Console should show:
     ```
     📦 Loading model: Circuit Breaker from circuit-breaker.stl
     Building component: digital-input {...}
     ✅ Built component: Circuit Breaker type: digital-input
     🔄 Loading CAD model for Circuit Breaker from libs/model/circuit-breaker.stl...
     ✅ Component added and snapped to mounting: Circuit Breaker
     📥 Loading: 100.0%
     ✅ STL geometry loaded: BufferGeometry {...}
     ✅ STL mesh created: 2706270 vertices
     ✅ CAD model loaded for Circuit Breaker: libs/model/circuit-breaker.stl
     ```

5. **Verify correct model**
   - Initially see placeholder box geometry
   - After loading completes, see detailed STL mesh
   - Component name should match button text

## ✅ Expected Behavior

### Console Output (Good):
- ✅ "📦 Loading model: [Name] from [file]"
- ✅ "🔄 Loading CAD model for [Name] from libs/model/[file]..."
- ✅ "✅ STL mesh created: [vertices] vertices"
- ✅ "✅ CAD model loaded for [Name]: libs/model/[file]"

### Console Output (Bad - Should NOT appear):
- ❌ "TransformControls: The attached 3D object must be a part of the scene graph"
- ❌ "⚠️ CAD model not found for [type], using ComponentBuilder geometry"

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

- [ ] All 6 models appear in sidebar
- [ ] Clicking each model adds it to scene
- [ ] Models load with correct names (not "Digital Input Module", etc.)
- [ ] No TransformControls warnings in console
- [ ] Models positioned with slight variation (not all at same spot)
- [ ] Placeholder geometry appears instantly
- [ ] Detailed STL mesh replaces placeholder after loading
- [ ] Can select and move models with TransformControls

## 🐛 If Something's Wrong

### Models not appearing in sidebar:
```javascript
// Check console for:
"❌ Failed to load catalog"
// Solution: Verify libs/model/catalog.json exists
```

### Wrong model loading:
```javascript
// Check console for model file path:
"🔄 Loading CAD model for [Name] from libs/model/[file]..."
// Should match the button you clicked
```

### TransformControls warnings still appearing:
```javascript
// Check if you have latest scene.js with:
if (mesh.parent === this.scene || this.scene.getObjectById(mesh.id)) {
    this.transformControls.attach(mesh);
}
```

## 📊 Model Mapping

| Sidebar Button | Component Type | STL File | Expected Name |
|---|---|---|---|
| Motor Controller | motor | motor-controller.stl | Motor Controller |
| PLC CPU | cpu | plc-cpu.stl | PLC CPU |
| Circuit Breaker | circuit-breaker | circuit-breaker.stl | Circuit Breaker |
| Emergency Push Button | button | emergency-push-button.stl | Emergency Push Button |
| PCB Mount Relay | relay | pcb-mount-relay.stl | PCB Mount Relay |
| Stack LED Light | led | stack-led-light.stl | Stack LED Light |

## 🚀 Success Indicators

1. **Console is clean** (no repeated warnings)
2. **Models load with catalog names** (not generic type names)
3. **Correct STL files load** (check file paths in console)
4. **Models appear in different positions** (randomization working)
5. **Can interact with loaded models** (select, move, rotate)

All tests passing? ✅ **System is working perfectly!**
