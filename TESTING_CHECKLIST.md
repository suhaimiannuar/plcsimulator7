- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (Mac only)

### Console Errors
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] No missing module errors
- [ ] No undefined function errors
- [ ] No 404 errors for module files

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

1. **Module Load Order**: If any errors occur, check browser console for:
   - "ReferenceError: CONFIG is not defined"
   - "ReferenceError: state is not defined"
   - "ReferenceError: elements is not defined"
   - These indicate modules loading in wrong order

2. **Function Dependencies**: Watch for:
   - Functions calling other functions before they're defined
   - Circular dependencies between modules

3. **State Consistency**: Verify:
   - State changes propagate correctly across modules
   - No race conditions in simulation
   - History stack doesn't overflow

## üìä Performance Testing

- [ ] Application loads quickly (< 1 second)
- [ ] Rendering is smooth (no lag)
- [ ] Simulation runs at expected speed
- [ ] No memory leaks during long simulation
- [ ] Drag-and-drop is responsive
- [ ] Undo/redo is instant

## üîÑ Comparison Testing

### Before Refactoring (script.js):
- Single 3099-line file
- All functions worked

### After Refactoring (13 modules):
- [ ] All previous functionality works
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] New features (drag/copy/paste/undo) work
- [ ] Performance is same or better

## ‚úÖ Final Approval

Once all items checked:
- [ ] All tests passed
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Ready to delete original script.js

## üöÄ Next Steps After Approval

1. Delete original script.js:
   ```bash
   rm script.js
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: Remove original monolithic script.js"
   ```

2. Optional future enhancements:
   - Convert to ES6 modules (import/export)
   - Add TypeScript
   - Add unit tests
   - Bundle with webpack
   - Minify for production

## üìû Support

If any issues found during testing:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify index.html has correct module loading order
3. Review MODULAR_STRUCTURE.md for module details
4. Review MODULE_DEPENDENCIES.md for dependency info
5. Original script.js is still available as backup
